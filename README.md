# 30 Days Challenge ðŸš€

This repository contains my **30 Days Challenge**, where I solve at least one problem every day from the HackerRank learning platform.  
The goal is to practice consistency, improve problem-solving skills, and track my progress publicly.  

## ðŸ“Œ About the Challenge
- Each file (`day0`, `day1`, `day2`, â€¦) contains the solution(s) for that day.  
- Problems may include algorithms, data structures, or real-world coding exercises, and others to learn from.  
- Iâ€™ll update this repo daily with new challenges and solutions.

## âœ… Progress Tracker
- [x] **Day 0** â€“ *(To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line,
   and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.)*  
- [x] **Day 1** â€“ *(Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
   Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
   Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
   Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
   Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
   Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.)*  
- [x] **Day 2** â€“ *(Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price 
   being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. 
   Round the result to the nearest integer.)*  
- [ ] **Day 3** â€“ *(to be added)*  
- [ ] **Day 4** â€“ *(to be added)*  
- [ ] **Day 5** â€“ *(to be added)*
